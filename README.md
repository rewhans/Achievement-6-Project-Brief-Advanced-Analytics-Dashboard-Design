# 🔐 Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015–2024)

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes global cybersecurity incidents from 2015 to 2024 to identify hidden patterns in financial loss, user exposure, resolution time, and organizational response strategies. It is designed for a C-suite healthcare audience, with a focus on practical, high-level insights that inform risk mitigation strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To explore large-scale cybersecurity threat data and deliver actionable insights via an executive-friendly dashboard that highlights trends, clusters, and strategic recommendations for healthcare organizations.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Tableau Public**
- **GitHub**

---

## 📌 Key Findings

- **Finance and healthcare industries** report the highest average financial losses.
- **Proactive defense mechanisms** correlate with faster resolution times.
- **No strong linear relationship** was found between resolution time and financial loss.
- **User exposure** is an unreliable predictor of financial loss.
- **Cluster analysis** reveals distinct risk profiles across incidents — enabling tailored response strategies.

## 🧪 Data Sources & Ethics

This project uses openly available data on global cybersecurity threats. However, it's important to note:

- Some data may suffer from **self-reporting bias**
- Financial loss values may be **estimated or incomplete**
- Resolution time may vary significantly across organizations
- No private or sensitive data was used

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Invest in proactive defenses** (e.g., intrusion detection) to reduce average response time.
- **Use cluster-based risk profiles** to drive strategic planning and resource allocation.
- **Don’t assume faster resolution = less financial loss** — investigate contextual factors.

## 📌 Summary

This project reveals that traditional metrics like user count and response time don’t reliably predict financial damage from cyberattacks. Instead, leveraging a combination of clustering, regression, and visualization provides a clearer view of cyber risk, empowering healthcare leaders to act more decisively and effectively.
